Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, and it can cause pain during menstruation and sexual activity. Masturbation itself should not cause pain, but if you are experiencing pain during masturbation it could be due to the endometriosis or another underlying issue.\\n\\nThere are several things you can try to help manage the pain you are experiencing:\\n\\nTalk to your doctor: It's important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor so they can determine the cause of the pain and recommend appropriate treatment.

Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga may be helpful.\\n\\nUse over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can help relieve pain.\\n\\nUse heat or cold therapy: Applying heat or cold to the painful area may help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.\\n\\nTry different sexual positions: Some positions may be more comfortable than others, so experimenting with different positions during masturbation or sexual activity may help reduce pain.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that everyone's experience with endometriosis is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.

If the condition does not improve with treatment or if it worsens, it is important to contact a healthcare provider for further evaluation and management.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[It is generally not a good idea to try to pop pimples, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially cause scarring. It is best to leave pimples alone and allow them to heal on their own.\\n\\nTo help manage your daughter's pimple and prevent new ones from forming, you can try the following:\\n\\nKeep the affected area clean: Wash the area with a gentle, oil-free cleanser twice a day. Avoid scrubbing or picking at the pimple.\\n\\nApply a spot treatment: Look for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.\\n\\nUse a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is labeled \"non-comedogenic,\" which means it won't clog pores. Moisturizing the skin can help keep it healthy and prevent new pimples from forming.\\n\\nAvoid certain triggers: Some things can make pimples more likely to form, such as squeezing or picking at the skin, using oil-based skin care products, and not removing makeup before bed. Encourage your daughter to avoid these triggers.\\n\\nIt's also a good idea to have your daughter see a dermatologist or healthcare provider if the pimple persists or if you are concerned about her skin in any way. The dermatologist can evaluate the pimple and recommend appropriate treatment.]</td>\n",

       "1121  [It is generally not a good idea to try to pop pimples, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially cause scarring. It is best to leave pimples alone and allow them to heal on their own.\\n\\nTo help manage your daughter's pimple and prevent new ones from forming, you can try the following:\\n\\nKeep the affected area clean: Wash the area with a gentle, oil-free cleanser twice a day. Avoid scrubbing or picking at the pimple.\\n\\nApply a spot treatment: Look for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.\\n\\nUse a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is labeled \"non-comedogenic,\" which means it won't clog pores. Moisturizing the skin can help keep it healthy and prevent new pimples from forming.\\n\\nAvoid certain triggers: Some things can make pimples more likely to form, such as squeezing or picking at the skin, using oil-based skin care products, and not removing makeup before bed. Encourage your daughter to avoid these triggers.\\n\\nIt's also a good idea to have your daughter see a dermatologist or healthcare provider if the pimple persists or if you are concerned about her skin in any way. The dermatologist can evaluate the pimple and recommend appropriate treatment.]  "

Primolut N is a medication that contains the hormone norethisterone, which is used to regulate the menstrual cycle and treat menstrual disorders. When taken during pregnancy, it can interfere with the normal development of the fetus and increase the risk of birth defects. If you are pregnant and have taken Primolut N, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They will be able to advise you on the best course of action and provide any necessary medical care to ensure the health and safety of you and your baby.</td>\n",

It is important to note that the treatment for a kidney problem, including the use of medications, will depend on the specific cause and severity of the condition. The medications that your father has been prescribed are likely intended to address his specific health needs and it is not appropriate for me to recommend changes to his treatment plan without a thorough understanding of his medical history and current health status.It is important that your father follows the treatment plan prescribed by his healthcare provider and takes his medications as directed. If you have concerns about the medications he is taking or the treatment plan in general, it is important to discuss these with his healthcare provider. They will be able to provide you with more information and guidance on your father's specific situation.   \n",
       "350  I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing abdominal pain and have been prescribed Silbostin and a blood pressure medication. It's important to follow your doctor's advice and take your medications as directed.Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, is a condition in which excess fat accumulates in the liver. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar levels. If left untreated, it can lead to more serious liver problems such as cirrhosis or liver failure.Silbostin is a medication that is used to treat certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It is not typically used to treat fatty liver disease. If you have been prescribed Silbostin, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions and ask any questions you may have about the medication.It is also important to manage any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your abdominal pain, such as high blood pressure. Be sure to follow your doctor's recommendations for managing your blood pressure, including taking your blood pressure medication as directed and making lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.If you continue to experience abdominal pain or have any other concerns, it is important to speak with your doctor. They will be able to provide further guidance and help determine the cause of your symptoms.   \n",

The risk of transmission of HBV from an HBV-positive man to an HBV-negative woman during pregnancy or childbirth is relatively low, and can be further reduced with proper preventive measures.If you and your husband are planning to conceive and you are HBV-negative, it is recommended that you get vaccinated against HBV before becoming pregnant. This will provide you with immunity to the virus and reduce the risk of transmission to you and your baby.If you are unable to get vaccinated before becoming pregnant, you should discuss the options for preventing transmission of HBV with your healthcare provider. This may include receiving immune globulin and/or antiviral medications during pregnancy.It is also important for your husband to manage his HBV infection by taking his medications as prescribed and practicing safe sex to reduce the risk of transmission to you and any children you may have.If you have been trying to conceive for over a year without success, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and discuss treatment options. There may be other factors contributing to your difficulty conceiving, such as fertility issues or underlying health conditions. A healthcare provider can help you assess your fertility and discuss options for increasing your chances of conceiving.</td>\n",

       "540   It is generally safe for an HBV-negative woman to become pregnant with an HBV-positive man. The risk of transmission of HBV from an HBV-positive man to an HBV-negative woman during pregnancy or childbirth is relatively low, and can be further reduced with proper preventive measures.If you and your husband are planning to conceive and you are HBV-negative, it is recommended that you get vaccinated against HBV before becoming pregnant. This will provide you with immunity to the virus and reduce the risk of transmission to you and your baby.If you are unable to get vaccinated before becoming pregnant, you should discuss the options for preventing transmission of HBV with your healthcare provider. This may include receiving immune globulin and/or antiviral medications during pregnancy.It is also important for your husband to manage his HBV infection by taking his medications as prescribed and practicing safe sex to reduce the risk of transmission to you and any children you may have.If you have been trying to conceive for over a year without success, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and discuss treatment options. There may be other factors contributing to your difficulty conceiving, such as fertility issues or underlying health conditions. A healthcare provider can help you assess your fertility and discuss options for increasing your chances of conceiving.   \n",

It is possible that the wart has become infected or that it is not a wart at all, but rather a different type of growth. It is important to have any unusual growth on your skin checked by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. They will be able to examine the growth and determine if it is a wart or something else, and recommend the appropriate course of treatment. It is not recommended to try to treat the growth at home, as this can potentially make the situation worse or lead to further complications.   \n",

Hormonal imbalance can lead to intermenstrual spotting, prolonged spotting after cessation of menstrual flow etc symptoms. - Post coital tear- Local lesions like cervical erosion, polyps etc. If the spotting subsides and if you get your next cycle as expected, no need to worry. If the spotting continues or recurs in next menstrual cycles, better to get evaluated. Go for examination, ultrasound and hormonal profile including estrogen, progesterone, LH and FSH. With this workup the possible cause for your problem can be identified and treated. Take care.   \n",

       "320   Recurring pain in upper left abdomen, occurs on yawning, coughing, shallow breathing. Causes for symptoms?I have been experiencing recurring pain in my upper left abdomen - this is my 3rd attach in 7 weeks. Usually the pain will be severe for the first 2 - 3 days and then will mainly become troublesome when yawning / coughing / deep breathing. There are times when the pain can be bad it prevents me from breathing properly - mainly shallow breathing . Any suggestions of what this could be?   \n",

       "231   Elevated levels of SGPT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase), also known as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), can be a sign of liver damage or disease. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.There are many potential causes of elevated SGPT, including viral infections such as hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and certain medications. In your case, it is possible that the dengue fever you had may have contributed to the elevation in your SGPT level.It is important to follow the advice of your healthcare provider and to undergo further testing to determine the underlying cause of your elevated SGPT. This may include blood tests, imaging studies, and possibly a liver biopsy. Treatment may involve medications, lifestyle changes, or in some cases, surgery.It is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including eating a well-balanced diet, avoiding alcohol or limiting consumption, and exercising regularly to support liver health.   \n",

It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, fullness, chest pressure etc. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. 7. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.</td>\n",

       "543   Your mother is suffering from CIPN meaning chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.Peripheral neuropathy is disorder of nerves apart from the brain and spinal cord. Patients with peripheral neuropathy may have tingling, numbness, unusual sensations, weakness, or burning pain in the affected area. Oftentimes, the symptoms are symmetrical and involve both hands and feet. Because the symptoms are often present in the areas covered by gloves or stockings, peripheral neuropathy is often described as having a “glove and stocking” distribution of symptoms.Chemotherapeutic drugs cause peripheral neuropathy, including the plant alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel , platinum-based compounds (cisplatin,carboplatin and oxaliplatin).Your mother has bowel cancer and is most probably using chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin which causes the ocuurence of CIPN is as high as 70 to 90%.CIPN takes time to get reduced.It takes about 6 months to 1 year after completion of chemotherapy to get reduced totally.Your mother can take tablet Lyrica 75 mg twice daily after food for 1 month.It contains pregabalin which will help her to reduce her painful condition.   \n",

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of Central chest pain, fullness, chest pressure etc. So better to follow these steps. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drugs. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. 7. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.   \n",

The end result was an increase of my psa to over 5. I might add that I am 66 years old and less than a year ago my count was 2.9. I am to have a biopsy done in one weeks time. Does this signal that I have cancer?   \n",
